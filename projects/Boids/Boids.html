	<p>This project is my interpretation of Boids, or bird like objects exhibiting  patterns same that of their real inspirations. The following three main rules to this simulation: Cohesion, Dispersion, and Alignment. The Cohesion rule forces boids together, forcing them to what that boid thinks is the center of the flock. The Dispersion rule tells the boids to keep away from other boids as much as possible. If a boid gets too close, it will alter course from all close boids. Last of these main three is the Alignment rule which change the velocity of the boid to match all the other boids in the system. </p>
	<p>This Implementation also has other rules like wall boundaries, wandering behavior, and tendency/avoidance. The wall boundaries just keep the boids in the simulation within a certain area to properly show the simulation. The Wandering behavior is the when the target mode is switched and the pink disc wanders around the space. The disc will pick a random spot to go to and head within that direction. Lastly, tendency/avoidance controls how the boids react to the disc. If the slider controlling the rule is moved to the left, the boids will try and avoid the disc. If the slider is moved to the right, the boids will actively seek out the disc and head in that direction.</p>
